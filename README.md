# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis

This is a sentiment analysis project for classifying stock prices as decreasing or increasing based on News Headlines.
I've used Random Forest Classifier with CountVectorizer for this project.
There are 4000+ records for 25 Top News Headlines for a given date.
The data is available for time period from 2000 to 2016.
